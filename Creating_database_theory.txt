Datatypes:
Boolean --> True or false
Character -->char, varchar and text
Numeric --> int, float
Temporal --> date, time, timestamp and interval
Some other not as common ones are things like UUID or universally unique identifiers, which is essentially
an algorithmically unique code in order to make sure you have a unique identifier for a particular row.

Then you also have things like arrays which store an array of strings, numbers, etc. You can also

store things like JSON.

There's a store which is a key value pair, and there are special types such as a network address and
geometric data.

Constraints:
Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on a table.
constraints are used to prevent invalid data from being entered into the database.
This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.

Constraints can generally be divided into two main categories:
--There are constraints on a column which constrains the data in a single column to adhere to certain conditions.
--And then there are table constraints which are applied to the entire table, rather to just an individual column.

Common constraints:
NOT NULL --> column has not null values.
UNIQUE --> all values are different in column.
PRIMARY KEY -->So the primary key uniquely identifies each row or record in a database table.
FOREIGN KRY -->a foreign key constraintsdata based on columns and other tables. So when you're setting up a foreign key, you'll actually also set up a relationship to another table
CHECK -->check constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy just some certain general condition.
EXCLUSIVE -->The exclusion constraint ensures that if any two rows are compared on the specified column or expression
using the specified operator that you include, if the inclusion constraint that not all of these comparisons
will return true.
